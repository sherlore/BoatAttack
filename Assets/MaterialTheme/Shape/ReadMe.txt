Shape images are in size of 1024x1024 px.

Shapes were created based on Material Design 3 guideline (https://m3.material.io/styles/shape/shape-scale-tokens) with 1dp = 10px.
For example, Extra large rounding has corners of 28dp, which were drawn as 280px in the image.


In Unity, import settings of "Sprite Mode" should be set to Single and "Pixel Per Unit" = 1024


The suggest of "Pixels Per Unit Multiplier" in "Image" component is 1.
