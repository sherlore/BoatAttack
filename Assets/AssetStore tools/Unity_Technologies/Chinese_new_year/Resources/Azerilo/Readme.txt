Welcome!

This is a modified version of Unity standard Material that could be used to render both sides of a mesh. It can be used on all platforms. 
Also Transparent material is supported. You can use textures with alpha channel to make two sided meshes like leaves or grasses. 
All shader parameters are like the standard shader.

To use this shader in your project just copy the "Double Sided Standard Shader" folder into your project. 

After creating a material you can choose this shader from shader tab of the material at Azerilo->Double Sided Standard sub menu.

See demo scene and look at the material used for the trash can sample.
